# Recap Project 4: Weather & Activities App

In this recap project, you'll work together with a partner: you'll create an app that fetches a weather object from an API and conditionally picks activities from a list to display as suggestions. You'll need to implement a feature that allows you to add more suggestions to the list of activities and also allows you to delete suggestions.

The way this app is going to handle data is a basic example of CRUD operations. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These operations are the main features every app needs.

Please note: the focus of this challenge is on React logic (and not on design), which is why the wireframes only have a very basic styling. Due to the given timeframe, you can consider styling the app as bonus task at the very end ;).

ðŸš€ You will deploy this project using Vercel. The owner of the project needs to create an account there and together as a team, you'll read the instructions in their guide and learn how to deploy the project by yourselves. You can find step-by-step instructions in the Vercel documentation, which you can access here: Vercel Documentation.

Tasks:

- Add Activity Form
- List Component
- Filtering the List
- Fetch API
- Delete an Item
